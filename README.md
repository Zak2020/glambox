A python toolbox for the Gaze Weighted Linear Accumulator Model (GLAM).

**NOTE: This toolbox project is still under development and should be considered BETA.**

For an example use of an earlier version of the model code, see the paper [Gaze Bias Differences Capture Individual Choice Behavior](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0584-8) and corresponding [repository](https://github.com/glamlab/gaze-bias-differences).
